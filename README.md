# LinearModels

A linear model is a statistical model that provides a relation between a set of predictors and a dependent variable in a mathematical form.
The term linear indicates that the resultant ("fitted") equation is linear (degree 1) in the predictors. 
There is a convention to define linearity as linear in the unknown (to be estimated) weights / coefficients / betas. However, here it is linear in the predictors

Once such equation is obtained (model is fitted) there are few more tasks to do in terms of knowing the statistical significance of the estimated betas and other model diagnostics
Here, we provide few of them with formula and meaning. Also, short notes on variance components and bias-variance trade-off is included together with its role in Predictive Models which is slightly different from Interpretable models in terms of the objective.
