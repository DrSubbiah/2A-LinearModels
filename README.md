# LinearModels

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of linear and generalized linear models, including their mathematical foundations, derivations, and practical implementations in Python.

## Overview

### What is a Linear Model?

A linear model is a statistical model that describes the relationship between a set of predictors (independent variables) and a dependent variable (target) in a mathematical form. The term "linear" indicates that the resulting ("fitted") equation is linear (degree 1) in the predictors. 

It is important to note that linearity refers to being linear in the unknown weights (coefficients, or betas) that need to be estimated, rather than in the predictors themselves.

### Model Fitting and Diagnostics

Once the model is fitted, several tasks are necessary to evaluate the statistical significance of the estimated betas and to conduct model diagnostics. This repository includes:

- **Statistical Significance**: Formulas and interpretations to assess the significance of the coefficients.
- **Model Diagnostics**: Methods to evaluate the fit of the model, including residual analysis and goodness-of-fit metrics.
- **Variance Components**: Discussion of variance in the context of linear models, including the concepts of bias-variance trade-off and its implications for predictive models versus interpretable models.
