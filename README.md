# LinearModels

A linear model is a statistical model that provides a relation between a set of predictors and a dependent variable in a mathematical form.
The term linear indicates that the resultant ("fitted") equation is linear (degree 1) in the predictors. 
There is a convention to define linearity as linear in the unknown (to be estimated) weights / coefficients / betas. However, here it is linear in the predictors
